    <h2>On Misguided Slogans</h2>
    "Make racists afraid again" is a saying that I have a problem with.  I repeatedly flipped over a sign that said that on campus at UCSC.  It's so misguided, as if people who are racists should be stricken with fear rather than reasoned with and educated with open discourse.  Racists are people who lack critical thinking skills.  The goal of making them scared is making it difficult for me to not use the word stupid.  

How about, "Encourage racists to be more open-minded and compassionate".  

It's almost funny to me how no one sees that we should be kind to racists, and treat them as children who don't understand science.  It seems we've abandoned the brilliant Christian principle of seeing through our enemies and praying for them rather than judging them.  

Given that people can change, a racist is nothing more than a constantly changing person and the best way to change that person is to treat them with respect and discuss critical issues with them to try to change their minds.  Making them afraid is such an embarrassingly shallow-minded goal that I feel very strongly that the general level of intelligence behind such slogans is strikingly low and truly embarrassing intellectually.
<p>Racists are a subset of people, logically speaking.  So saying, "Make racists afraid again", is logically equivalent to saying, "Make some people afraid again."  This is a deplorable goal to aim for.  Make racists love again.  Don't you see?  Don't you get it?  We can't even hit the targets we choose but we can at least pick a decent target.  Making people afraid is not even in the right direction; it's denying a person's ability to learn and subsequently change their minds. </p>

<h2>On My Intelligence</h2>
<p>I am at 73% Mastery of Algebra 2 on khanacademy.org and I find it to be very difficult</p>
<p>My plan is to Master each subject until I get as high as I can and I started in Preschool after graduating college</p>
<p>I'm working on the assumtion that I don't know as much as I think I do, and Math does a great job at making it explicitly clear that my knowledge is lacking</p>
<p>I want to solve complex problems in the world for all people, but before I do that I must learn the basics</p>
<p>It is my opinion that almost no one including myself is in any credible position to have opinions on how to solve complex problems in the world when the truth is we understand very little about even high school level math.  I think the Humanities disciplines in college are too soft, and the STEM graduates are sharpening their mind at a higher level on average.</p>
<p>Intelligence is not static and that is why I teach myself math and other subjects.  I want to be intelligent, but I admit that I am not, and will not be, unless I continue to excersise my faculties.</p>
<p>If there was a graph of intelligence, you'd have Socrates on one side, claiming to know nothing, and the American voter towards the other, claiming they know what America should do. The Dunning-Kruger effect in action.</p>

<h2>On Artificial Intelligence</h2>
<p>Elon Musk and Steven Hawking are people we should pay attention to when they warn us of the AI breakthrough coming.  I think it's a critical time to be alive and I want to become as smart as possible so I can be of some use in ushering in the new AI into the living spacetime.</p>

<h2>On Quantum Physics</h2>
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/quantum-circle-maxwell-jann/">My article on the Double-Slit Experiment</a>

<h2>On the Mandela Effect</h2>
<p>I think it has more to do with Retrocausality than it does confabulation, if you catch my drift. I consider this an advanced topic, and certainly not a trivial one.</p>

<h2>On Conformity for Employability</h2>
<p>I used to think my nuanced opinions would get me into trouble and they still might but the truth is harder than that.  The truth is I'm not worth the money, with or without the opinions.  The moment I'm worth the money, is the moment I'll get the job.  So I work on becoming better and computer programming and math until someone's willing to pay me for it so they don't have to do it themselves, regardless of my personal beliefs.  </p>

<h2>On College Censorship</h2>
<p>Hate speech is an interesting topic.  The only way to combat leftist ideology is to use it against them.  They're so logically twisted that they don't know what to do when you turn their own pretzeled logic against them.  For example, I once accompanied my friend into a Linsay-Shepherd-type ambush because I was his "support buddy".  Really I acted as his lawyer.  He was my friend I played chess with and my roommate got him kicked out for racial slurs.  I wouldn't have been allowed in the room to share my side of the story even though I was the only witness, it was my room, my friend, and my roommate.  No one had a better view of the he said/he said scene then me and they didn't even want to hear what I had to say.  They simply wanted to scold and reprimand my friend because a complaint was filed from another student.
    But due to their coddle-code student policies I was able to enter the room as a "Support Buddy" and expose their insanity.  First of all, not only were they not interested in the one witnesses account, but I also pointed out that my roommate said absolutely nothing to me.  He went straight to the administration, who went straight to removing my friend from the building. 
    This is wrong on so many levels.  College is literally the best possible location for a white kid and a black kid to discuss which racial slurs are appropriate and have uncomfotable conversations in order to learn and prepare for the real world.  Instead they want us insulated.  The administration should be there for recourse if my roommate had complained to me and I said, "too bad" and let the harassment continue.  This step was skipped and my friend was immediately removed from his bedroom.  Think about that.  Better watch what you say in college, and not say anything provocative or you won't sleep in the same place at night.  Universities are terrifying their students into policed speech.  
    They are stepping in too soon and not even giving me a chance to hear my roommates complaint and take steps to rectify it myself.  They give us no room to grow and handle anything ourselfs.  What's the point of leaving home for college if they're even more overbearing than Mom and Dad!?  Seriously.  Absolutely sickening.  The classes there were a joke.  One TA took 30 out of 45 mintues every discussion section going around the room introducting people or doing some bullshit thing like we were in preschool.  And the moment I want to discuss something nuanced and provative I had someone shout at me that trans people were beaten up that week or something, as if that has anything to do with a college philosophy student raising provactive questions.  I went to Santa Cruz in 2010, failed out and graduated 2017.
    Within those 7 years the political correctness has spiralled out of control and I have been meaning to write a scathing review of that school since I left, as beautiful and great as it was overall.  It's getting so much worse.  It's a crisis of stupidity passed off as moral superiority.  Nietzsche is rolling over in his grave.
    The TA's name was Dana.  The Professor was Mohammed.  The class was bullshit.  It was a class on Feminism where you weren't allowed to discuss Feminism.  It should have been called Feminism Cheerleading Tryouts.
